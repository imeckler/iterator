an `Int` indicating its "length". It's a simple data type supporting mapping,
concatenation, and most importantly, folding in constant space with early return.

{-| `foldWhile` allows you to fold, returning early if you like, in constant space (stack or otherwise).
Suppose for example that we'd like to find the first element in a sequence of `a`'s satisfying some property
`p : a -> Bool`. We can express this as a fold over our sequence (assuming it supports some notion of `fold`) as

    fold (\x r -> if p x then Just x else r) Nothing

but we would like for this fold to return early with the first `x` satisfying `p`.
So, we have foldWhile which stops folding once a `Finished x` value is found. We
can thus express `find : (a -> Bool) -> Iterator a -> Maybe a` as

    find f = foldWhile (\x _ -> if f x then Finished (Just x) else KeepGoing Nothing)
               (KeepGoing Nothing)
